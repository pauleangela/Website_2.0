       Germ Theory is one of the most important and well-known theories in the field of medicine. This theory explains how diseases are caused by microorganisms known as germs and how they spread from one person to another. Germ Theory is related to the field of medical technology because it has revolutionized the way medical practitioners treat and prevent diseases. In this essay, we will discuss how Germ Theory changed the field of medicine, the events before this breakthrough, and its impact on the field of science, claimed by the study of (Harvard Library, 2022).

     <a>Negative Activity/Habits that affect our environment </a>
     <div class="TextArea">
     The current lifestyle is characterized by an excessive use of energy, habits of consumption and a dependency on plastic waste that threaten the quality of our world's life. Our dependence on renewable energy sources, such as coal or oil, also exacerbates the emission of greenhouse gasses contributing to climate change. The throwaway culture and the fast fashion industry produce enormous amounts of waste, while single use plastics in landfills and oceans are threatening marine ecosystems.

     <a>Positive Activity/Habits that affect our environment</a>
     <div class="TextArea">
      The breakthrough of Germ Theory was paradigm-shifting because it contradicted long-held beliefs about the causes of diseases. Germ Theory stated that diseases were not caused by mystical forces or bad air, but by living microorganisms that could be seen under a microscope. This theory helped medical practitioners to understand how germs spread and how to control the spread of infections. It revolutionized the field of medicine and paved the way for advanced medical technology in diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases.

     <a>How to Save Mother Earth</a>
     <div class="TextArea">
      How can I help save our planet/mother earth? First it requires my effort and the help of others. By doing the 3 R, which is reduce, reuse, recycle, it's a basic help but it will have a great impact for a change and helping. I should also promote the use of renewable source and have an advocacy for reduction using single use plastic that will harm our marine ecosystem.Water conservation practices, such as fixing leaks and using water-efficient fixtures, help ensure the responsible use of this vital resource.We should also promote a thriving local environment that supports biodiversity while using less resources by creating sustainable gardens. And also by planting trees and cleaning our environment, it will be a great help for our Earth.

     <a>Technology's Role in Environmental Preservation</a>
     <div class="TextArea">
      Innovation solutions for protecting the environment have opened up due to advances in technology. Due to advances in technology, we have been able to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels through the widespread use of alternative energy sources. The increasing efficiency and affordability of solar panels and wind turbines, which allow households and businesses to produce clean energy storage equipment such as batteries for the purpose of meeting renewable energy's intermittent nature, enable it to be a reliable source of power.</br></br>
It is essential for us to comprehend the major consequences of our choices, given that we have a shared world in which ecological challenges are still being confronted by advanced lifestyles. The urgency of change is underlined by the intertwined threads of our negative impact on the environment through excessive energy consumption, wastefulness, and the proliferation of single use plastics. However, change can't just be made; it has already begun. But change is not only possible; it is already underway. We're contributing to a better, more sustainable future through each eco-conscious choice, every move we take towards reducing our carbon footprint, and any piece of plastic that we don't want.
